# Lexical Anaylzer

Lexical analyzer performs the following tasks:

• Reads the source program, scans the input characters (input.txt), group them into lexemes and produce the token as output.

• Enters the identified token into the symbol table.

• Strips out white spaces and comments from source program.

• Correlates error messages with the source program i.e., log error message (error.txt) with its occurrence by specifying the line number.

• Expands the macros if it is found in the source program.

# Tasks of lexical analyzer can be divided into two processes:

Scanning: Performs reading of input characters, removal of white spaces and comments.

Lexical Analysis: Produce tokens as the output.
